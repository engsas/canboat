Description: Small set of utilities to work with CAN networks on BOATs
 The most common version of CAN networks on board, and in fact at the moment
 the only ones that this suite can analyze, are NMEA 2000 PGNs.
 .
 The NMEA 2000 database and implementation is copyrighted by the NMEA (National
 Marine Electronics Association). Access is restricted to members and parties
 that pay for it. If they do so they are not able to divulge the content of the
 database, thus making it impossible for open source developers to get access to
 it.

 This package contains the utilities.
